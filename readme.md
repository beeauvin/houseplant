# ðŸª´ houseplant ðŸª´

a set of tools for managing your typescript projects and repositories

At the moment this project does two things:

1. Replaces the tasks/clean file I have in 80,000,000 projects.
2. Allows me to reuse some github actions/workflows I've rewritten half as many times.

I plan to expand it pretty quickly though, there's lots of things I do in multiple repositories that I don't want to keep doing anymore. Similar to [sunbeams](https://github.com/cassiecascade/sunbeams) except this is more focussed on the repo itself.

Big plans for this little houseplant.
